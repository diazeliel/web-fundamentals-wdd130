    <h2>Eliel Diaz</h2>
    <pre>I`m from Honduras, I´m studying bachelor's science
     in software development, I like swimming, and I spend time with my wife.
     We don`t have children yet; I´m currently self-employed, 
     and I love the teachings of BYU-Idaho because they align with the 
     teachings of the prophets and apostles.</pre>
    <pre>I´m pursuing the WDD degree because I love technology and creating things. 
     Web design allows me to use my creativity and gifts to create amazing things.
     One advantage of studying web design is that I can create or administrate my own website.</pre>
    <pre>I have been a member of the church since my childhood.
     My favorite scripture is the first chapter and first verse of 
     the book of 1 Nephi, where he talks about his family,
     and I can learn that all families are important to God.</pre>
     <pre> This is a new pre</pre>
